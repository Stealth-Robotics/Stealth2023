we like to code röböt
## Git Workflow
**Do not push to main**. If you want to add a new feature, create a **feature branch**. This can be done by going to Branches -> View All Branches -> Create a new branch. Clone main into the branch, and code whatever you need to code! Once it is tested and **ready to go on the robot**, and it is commented where neccessery with readable formatting, create a pull request by going to Pull Requests -> Create Pull Request and select the branch you have been working on. Write out a **detailed** description of your changes and submit the pull request. One of the team's verified reviewers will go through and test your changes. They may leave comments and request changes to your code, and once all changes and comments are resolved, your changes will be merged into main and the branch will be deleted.

If you have submitted a pull request, and it has been a full meeting and the review process has not started on your pull request, feel free to message the reviewers on Slack!

Reviewers promise to always:
- Make sure to always respect the programmers. We understand that you do not have to write code exactly how we would, and we don't need to think or act like you.
- We will always only evalcuate code based on how it will affect the robot. If the code would hurt the robot, hurt people, or cause harm to the codebase of the robot later on, then we will work together to get the code to a place where it is ready to be on main. Reviewers are only there to look for bugs, leaky or broken abstractions, egregious effeincy issues, and redundant functionaily or duplicated code.
- We will not focus on things like extra parentheses, variable names that we dont like, or other petty things that don't actually matter. These will only be commented on if they are truly confusing and could cause other programmers on the team to slip up. 

Putting your code out there to review is hard. We know you spent time and energy making that code, and for many it can feel like a form of self expression. It is hard to do, and we acknoledge that. The reviewers will **always** be respectful and will only offer information for the benefit of your coding knowledge and the health of the robot. We look forward to coding with all of you!
