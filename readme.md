## Git Workflow
**Do not push to main**. If you want to add a new feature, create a **feature branch**. This can be done by going to Branches -> View All Branches -> Create a new branch. Clone main into the branch, and code whatever you need to code! Once it is tested and **ready to go on the robot**,  create a pull request by going to Pull Requests -> Create Pull Request and select the branch you have been working on. Write out a **detailed** description of your changes and submit the pull request. One of the team's verified reviewers will go through and test your changes. They may leave comments and request changes to your code, and once all changes and comments are resolved, your changes will be merged into main and the branch will be deleted.

If you have submitted a pull request, and it has been a full meeting and the review process has not started on your pull request, feel free to message the reviewers on Slack!
